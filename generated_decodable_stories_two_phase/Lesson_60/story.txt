Ben and Pam are pals.  
They play in the big yard.  
One day, Ben finds a red top.  
The top can spin fast.  
Pam says, “I like it!”  
Pam wants to spin the top too.  
Ben says, “Here, Pam.”  
Pam spins the top.  
The top hits a rock.  
“Oh no,” says Pam. “It is stuck!”  
Ben and Pam look at the rock.  
They think of a plan.  
Pam lifts the rock.  
Ben pulls the top away.  
The top is free!  
Pam tries again.  
The top spins and spins.  
Ben and Pam smile.  
They had fun with the top.
