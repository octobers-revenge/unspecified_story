UFLI Lesson 60: -ce = /s/

Ben and Meg are at the park.  
They have a race to plan.  

“This race will be nice!” says Meg.  
Ben grins and sets a fast pace.
  
The race will start at the red gate.  
The first one to the big tree will win. 
 
They hope to win a fun prize.  
Ben and Meg trace the path with their fingers.  

They note it is wise to race twice.  
The sun is up, and the day is hot.  

“Let’s grab some ice to cool,” says Meg.  
They sip on the ice and plan.  

Meg spots a group of mice in the grass.  
“Look at them race!” Ben laughs.  

“Those mice are quick!” says Meg. 
Now it is time to race at last. 
 
Ben and Meg start the race.  
They run with a smile across the green space.
