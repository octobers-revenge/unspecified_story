UFLI Lesson 35: short a review (incl. nasalized a)

Mom and Dad have a big map.  

They plan to go to the park. 
 
Sam has a red hat and a blue bag.  

At the park, Sam sees a flag.  

He runs fast to grab it.  

Mom calls, "Can we sit at the mat?"  

Dad gets a pan with ham and jam.  

Sam is glad to eat ham and jam.  

They all sit and rest by the lamp.  

At last, they look at the map and plan to go home.
