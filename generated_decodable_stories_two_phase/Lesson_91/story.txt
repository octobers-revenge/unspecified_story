UFLI Lesson 91: ew, ui, ue = /ū/

Tim and Meg sat on the hill.  
The hill was big and green.  
Tim had a red kite.  
Meg held a blue ball.  
They sat in the sun.  
They liked to play.  
The wind began to blow.  
"Let's fly the kite, Meg," said Tim.  
Meg nodded and smiled.  
Tim ran with the kite.  
The kite went up high.  
Meg clapped her hands.  
The wind stopped.  
The kite came down.  
Tim tried to catch it.  
The kite got stuck in a tree.  
Tim looked at Meg.  
"What will we do now?" asked Tim.  
Meg had an idea.  
"Let's use my ball," said Meg.  
Tim picked up the ball.  
He threw the ball.  
The ball hit the kite.  
The kite fell from the tree.  
"We got it!" shouted Meg.  
Tim smiled and hugged the kite.  
They played with the kite again.  
The sun set behind the hill.  
Tim and Meg walked home.
