UFLI Lesson 91: ew, ui, ue = /ū/

Tom was a small boy with a big dream.  
He wanted to build a cool treehouse.  
On Tuesday, he got a blueprint for his plan.  
The blueprint was new and very blue.  

His mom came to see his plan.  
She looked at it and smiled.  
Tom and his mom began to gather items.  
They found wood, nails, and a hammer. 
 
Tom's sister, Sue, also came to help.  
She brought some juice and fruit.  
Tom asked, "Can I have a sip?"  
Sue gave him juice and a big red apple. 
 
The wind blew strong all day.  
But they did not stop.  
Tom and Sue took turns with the hammer.  
Their arms got tired, but they kept on. 
 
At last, they had built the base.  
They were glad and took a break.  
Tom drew a big sun on the blueprint.  
He said, "This will be the top of the treehouse."  

On the next day, the work began again.  
Tom felt like it was a long cruise, not work.  
He ate some fruit while thinking.  
Sue said, "I will chew some gum."  

Tom laughed and nodded.  
After much effort, the treehouse was done.  
It was a fine new place for fun.  
Tom and Sue celebrated with more juice.
