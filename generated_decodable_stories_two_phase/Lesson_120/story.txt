UFLI Lesson 120: -ture

Max and Anna have a plan.  
They want to go on an adventure in nature.  
They get up early.  
Max and Anna pack a map and snacks.  
The weather is nice.  

Max takes a picture of the morning sky.  
They start down the path near their house.  
This adventure is to capture fun.  
Anna spots a bird.  
She points to it.  

Max nods and follows her.  
They walk into the forest.  
The path is filled with small stones.  
The path leads them to a sunny spot.  
Anna says the flowers have a soft texture.  
Max takes more pictures of the flowers.  

They see a mix of colors.  
Anna picks one flower.  
She gives it to Max.  
They follow the path and find a stream.  
Max listens to the sound of water flowing.  

They sit by the stream.  
Max and Anna enjoy their snacks there.  
Anna writes her name on a rock as a signature.  
Max adds his name too.  
Every step is a part of the adventure.  
Soon, the sun sets over the meadow.  

It is time for their departure.  
Max leads the way back home.  
Anna talks about all the fun they had.  
At home, they look at the pictures.  
The pictures are full of joy. 
 
Anna smiles and says, “Let’s do it again!”  
Max nods, feeling happy and full.  
Their adventure was a grand mixture of fun.  
Every picture tells a story of the day.  
They will nurture their friendship and adventures.  
The day ends with memories made.
