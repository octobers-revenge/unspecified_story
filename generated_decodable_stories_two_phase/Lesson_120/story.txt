UFLI Lesson 120: -ture

Max and Liz were friends.  
They lived by a big hill.  
The hill had a tall tree.  
One day, they had a plan.  
“Let's find treasure,” said Max.  
Liz had a map with her.  
The map showed the big tree.  
“We will dig by the tree,” said Liz.  
Max got a red box.  
It was for the treasure.  
They went to the big hill.  
The tree was tall and green.  
“This is the spot,” said Max.  
They started to dig.  
The sun was hot.  
But they did not stop.  
They dug and dug all day.  
At last, they saw a big lid.  
Under the lid was a chest.  
“Look, Liz! It’s the treasure!” said Max.  
They both had a smile.  
The chest was filled with coins.  
Max put the coins in the red box.  
“We did it,” said Liz.  
Max and Liz felt proud.  
They sat by the tree.  
The wind blew gently.  
“This was a fun day,” said Max.  
“Yes, it was!” said Liz.  
They closed the lid.  
They took the box home.  
“We will have more adventures,” said Max.  
Liz nodded with a grin.  
Max and Liz ran down the hill.
