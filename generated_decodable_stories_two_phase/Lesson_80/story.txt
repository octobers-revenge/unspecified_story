UFLI Lesson 80: er = /ər/

Mister Herb is a farmer.  
He has a sister named Fern.  
Herb and Fern have a big farm.  
There is a herd of cows on the farm.  

One day, Fern wrote a letter.  
Her letter had a rhyme and a verse.  
Fern asked Herb to read it.  
“Read it in a funny voice,” said Fern.  
Herb found it hard at first.  
He had to observe each word.  
Fern sat on her perch and laughed.  
Her laugh made Herb smile.  
After some tries, he did better.  
Reading aloud had a perk.  
It made Herb feel super.  
“I can serve more and more people!” said Herb.  
More kids came from far and wide.  
They loved to hear Herb read.  
A clerk from town asked for more fun.  
The term for fun was to start.  
Fern and Herb worked together.  
Their rhymes made each day bright.  
The farm became a happy place.  
People loved the fun and words.
