UFLI Lesson 80: er = /ər/

Max and Emma are pals.  
They like to play in the park after school.  
One sunny day, they see a cart.  
The cart is full of big red apples.  
Emma says, "Look, Max, I see apples!"  
Max and Emma walk to the cart.  
A man with a hat is by the cart.  
He smiles and waves at them.  
Emma says, "Can we help with the apples?"  
The man nods and says, "Yes, please."  
Max and Emma lift the apple bags one by one.  
Max hands a big red apple to Emma.  
Emma takes a bite and smiles.  
Max says, "These apples are so sweet."  
They fill bags with apple after apple.  
The man claps his hands and says, "Great job!"  
He gives Max and Emma a big apple each.  
"Thank you!" says Emma with a big grin.  
"Come help again!" says the man.  
Max and Emma wave goodbye.  
They sit on a bench and enjoy the apples.  
Max says, "Helping was fun!"  
Emma agrees and takes another bite.  
The sun sets, and they head home.  
Max and Emma had a day to remember.
