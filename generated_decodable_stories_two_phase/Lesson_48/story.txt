UFLI Lesson 48: ch = /ch/

Once upon a time, at a sunny ranch, there was a chap named Chuck.  

Chuck had a job to chop the wood for lunch.  

His chum, Chip, came to help.  

They sat on the bench to chat and made a plan.  

First, they went to check the big log.  

They used an ax to chop inch by inch.  

Each chop made a loud crunch. 
 
A small chick ran to check the noise. 
 
"It is much work," said Chuck, wiping his chin.  

Chip had a hunch they needed more help.  

They pulled a bunch of logs to the side.  

As they worked, they took a sip to quench thirst.  

At last, they clinched the task.  

They were glad to have such a good friend.  

Chuck and Chip sat down to rest.
