UFLI Lesson 48: ch = /ch/

Tom and Liz had a big red box.  
The box was on the rug.  
Tom said, "Let’s find fun things!"  
Liz said, "Yes, let’s look in the box."  
Tom and Liz sat on the rug.  
They lift the lid of the box.  
Inside, they see a toy pup.  
The toy pup has a big grin.  
Tom said, "The pup can hop!"  
Liz said, "See it flip and spin!"  
The pup went up and down.  
Then it sat in the box with Liz.  
Tom had a big laugh.  
Liz and Tom clapped and said, "What fun!"  
They put the lid back on the box.
