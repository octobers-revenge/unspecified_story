UFLI Lesson 95: oi, oy = /oi/

Roy is a boy who likes toys.
His room is full of toys and a big toy box.
Today, he found a new toy coil and a red foil ball.
His voice was full of joy as he played.

Roy wanted to join his pal to play outside.
He ran with his toys to the park.
He showed his pal his new toy coil and the shiny foil.
They sat on the soil to play.

Suddenly, they heard a loud noise from the nearby pond.
The boys went to look and saw a big frog on the moist soil.
The frog had found a shiny coin in the water.

The boys enjoyed watching the frog with their toys.
Then, a boy called Tim came to see what the fun was about.
Tim had a toy boat and shared his toy with Roy and his pal.

As the day ended, the boys made a choice to share all their toys.
“It was a fun day!” Roy said with a big smile.
He joined hands with his pals and waved goodbye.

They went home with their voices full of excitement.
Roy felt happy about the day and his new toy.
He knew he made the right choice to share and enjoy.

At home, Roy put his toys and the new coin in the box.
The day ended with joy in his heart and toys in his room.
Roy smiled as he said, “I love my toys and friends.”
