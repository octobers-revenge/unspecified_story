UFLI Lesson 37: short o review

A fox and a dog are pals.  
They like to jog at the pond.  
One hot day, the dog got a big mop.  
The fox did not have a job to do, so he sat on a log.  
The dog got the mop wet in the pond.  
But then, a pod fell on the dog!  
The dog sobs and nods.  
The fox hops and hops to help his pal.  
The fox and dog blot the pod.  
They bop and flop as they mop it up.  
The pond is not a bog now.  
The fox has fun and hops onto the log.  
The dog runs to the fox.  
The pals sit on the log and look at the pond.  
They are glad the pond is no longer a bog.  
The fox and the dog had a lot of fun.
