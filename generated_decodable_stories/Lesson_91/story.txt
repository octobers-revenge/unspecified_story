UFLI Lesson 91: ew, ui, ue = /ū/

Tim and his pup, Chip, loved fun days in the sun.  
One day, Tim found a new blue ball.  
"Look, Chip!" he said, "Let's play!"  
Chip wagged his tail, glad to play.  

Tim threw the blue ball in the air.  
Chip ran to get it, fast as the wind.  
But, oh no, the ball flew into a bush.  
Chip dug and dug to find the ball.  

Tim watched as Chip found not one, but two things!  
Alongside the ball, Chip found a new map.  
"Good job, Chip!" said Tim with a grin.  
"Let's see where this map leads us."

The map showed paths and a big pond.  
Tim and Chip were excited to explore.  
Tim packed a small bag with fruit and juice.  
They set off on their adventure.  

Tim used the map to guide them.  
First, they walked down a sunny path.  
Next, they crossed a small bridge.  
Chip sniffed the air, curious and happy.  

At the pond, a light breeze blew.  
Tim and Chip sat to rest and sip juice.  
A bird sang a sweet song from a tree.  
The day felt calm and perfect.

Tim thought about the new map and place.  
"It is like a big cruise!" he said.  
"You and me, Chip, on this cool trip!"  
Chip barked and wagged his tail, agreeing.  

As the sun began to set, they headed home.  
Tim and Chip felt glad from their big day.  
They had found new things and a fun spot.  
Tim said, "Tomorrow, we can come back!"

Chip barked and ran in circles, eager and happy.  
The day had been full of joy and fun.  
They returned home, tired but content.  
Tim gave Chip a good pat on his head.  

The last light of Tuesday faded.  
Tim smiled and said, "What a day! Goodnight, Chip."  
And with that, Tim and Chip went to sleep, dreaming of new adventures.
