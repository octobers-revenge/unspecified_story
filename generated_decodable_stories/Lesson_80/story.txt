UFLI Lesson 80: er = /ər/

Fern had a farm.
She was a kind farmer.
Her sister, Meg, helped on the farm.
Meg had a cat named Perch.

One warm day, Fern heard a loud noise.
A herd of deer was near the crops.
The herd began to munch on the corn.
Fern and Meg had to act fast.

“Quick, Meg!” yelled Fern.
“Get Perch to help us!” 

Meg ran to fetch Perch.
Perch dashed to the field and hissed at the deer.
The herd turned and ran back to the woods.

“Good job, Perch!” said Meg.
Fern was glad the crops were safe.
“Let us count the corn,” Fern said.

They sat and began to count.
“One, two, three,” they counted.
The number of corn was still high.
Fern and Meg cheered.

“That was a big job,” said Fern.
Meg nodded with a smile.
Fern gave Perch a big hug.
The farm was safe once more.
