UFLI Lesson 80: er = /ər/

Ned the farmer had a big herd.  
His sister Meg came to help.  
"I can serve some food," said Meg.  
Ned said, "The herd likes corn."  

Meg and Ned went under a tree.  
They sat on a log.  
A bird was on a perch.  
Ned said, "That bird is my friend."  

Meg had a map.  
The map had a red line.  
Ned said, "We can walk there."  
Meg said, "Let's take the path by the fern."  

Ned and Meg walked on the path.  
The sun was up and bright.  
"It is a nice day," said Ned.  
The herd grazed in the sun.  

Ned and Meg came back.  
"I will write a letter," said Meg.  
She wrote the letter to her mom.  
"Mister Ned had a good day," Meg wrote.  

Ned and Meg sat by the pond.  
They watched the herd.  
The number of cows was ten.  
"It is time to rest," said Ned.  

The cows went to the barn.  
Meg and Ned went too.  
Under the roof, the cows slept.  
"We did a lot," said Meg.  

Ned nodded and smiled.  
Ever after, Meg came to help.  
"Come back soon," said Ned.  
Meg waved and walked home.
