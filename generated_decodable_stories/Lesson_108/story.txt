UFLI Lesson 108: doubling rule: -er, -est

Tim had a mat.
The mat was wet from the rain.
Tim went to find the sun.
He wanted the mat to be dry.

Tim saw the sun come out.
The day got hotter than before.
Tim said, "The sun will help my mat!"
The sun got hotter and hotter.

Tim checked the mat.
It was not wet.
He was glad but then saw the pond.
It looked bigger and redder from the sun.

Tim felt sadder as the pond got bigger.
The slim pond was now the biggest pond.
Tim sat by the pond, feeling the glummest.
He wished for a smaller pond.

Tim had an idea.
He called his pal, Sam, for help.
Sam came with a big red cup.
"Let's move the water with this," said Sam.

They started to move the water.
The mat got wetter again, but Tim didn't mind.
"We can make it flat again," said Tim.
Soon, the pond was slimmer and smaller.

Tim was glad.
His mat was dry again.
He and Sam had done a big, fun job.
They sat on the dry mat and rested.

The day was the hottest, but they were the happiest.
Tim said, "This was the best day!"
Sam nodded and said, "Yes, we did it, Tim!"
They both smiled under the hot sun.
