UFLI Lesson 120: -ture

Max and his dog Pip had a sunny day at the park.

The park was a place with a lot of nature.

They would go on an adventure each Sunday.

Max had brought his picture book along.

He loved to capture the fun times he and Pip had.

Max found a big rock with a smooth texture.

Pip, with his tiny paws, made a funny mixture of dirt and grass.

Max laughed and took a picture of Pip in the dirt.

Then, they saw a bird with a bright feather.

The bird seemed to enjoy the park too.

Max tried to capture a picture of the bird.

The bird flew away with a swift departure.

Pip wagged his tail, excited by the bird's flight.

“Next time, Pip, we’ll capture it,” Max said with a grin.

Then, they found a pond with ducks swimming.

Max signed his name on the back of his picture.

He saw Pip try to nudge a duck with his nose.

Max had a plan to nurture his pictures, so they lasted.

He showed his picture of the park to another kid, Tim.

Tim gave a thumbs-up and asked to join Max and Pip.

The trio sat by the pond, making up stories of the ducks.

The kids shared tales of adventure and fun.

Max told Tim how he loved to capture moments.

Tim promised to bring his camera next time.

As the sun began to set, they packed up.

Pip was tired, and both kids were glad.

The park was an adventure for them all. 

Max felt happy and hoped for more Sundays like this.

Pip and Max waved goodbye to Tim and headed home.

Their day of fun was now a memory with a picture.
