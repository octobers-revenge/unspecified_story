UFLI Lesson 60: -ce = /s/

Max and Eve went to a nice park.
They had nice kites to fly.
Eve said, "Let's race to the hill."
Max was glad and said, "Let's race and have fun."

Eve ran fast, and Max ran with all his might.
Max saw a small mice hole in the grass.
He said, "I see a mice hole, Eve!"
Eve said, "We must not step on it."

They got to the hill and sat to rest.
Eve said, "The race was fun."
Max smiled and said, "You run at a fast pace."

Then, Eve said, "Look, Max! Ice on the pond!"
They got cold ice and made a nice, big cube.
Max gave Eve a nice cube for her bag.
She said, "Thank you, Max. This is a nice gift."

The sun set, and it was time to go.
Max and Eve took the path by the tall tree.
They saw the mice hole once more.
Eve said, "We must trace the way back home."

Max was glad they had fun at the park.
Eve was glad, too.
They had a nice day at the park.
Max and Eve went home with big smiles.
