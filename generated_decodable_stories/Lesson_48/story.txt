UFLI Lesson 48: ch = /ch/

Chuck is a small chap.  
He has a rich plan for lunch.  
His chum, Chip, will help him.  
They sit on a bench by the pond.  
Chuck has a big box.  
Out of the box, he pulls a bunch of chips.   
Chip looks at the chips and grins.  
"Let's have a quick lunch," says Chip.  
Chuck nods and they munch on the chips.  
A chick hops by and pecks at a chip.  
Chuck chuckles and gives the chick a small chip.  
Chip checks the box for more, but it's all gone.  
"We must get more for such a fun lunch," says Chip.  
Chuck and Chip stand up and dust off.  
They head off to find more yummy snacks.  
Their lunch at the bench was small but full of cheer.
