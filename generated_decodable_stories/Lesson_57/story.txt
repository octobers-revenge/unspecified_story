UFLI Lesson 57: VCe review 1: e_e = /ē/

Eve has a big white bike.  
She likes to ride it home.  
One day, she came to a stone gate.  
The gate was stuck and did not open.  
“That gate is broke,” said Eve.  
She felt sad and sat on the stone.  
Then Eve had a plan.  
“I will find a pole,” she said.  
Eve found a long pole by the lane.  
She came back to the gate.  
Eve used the pole to open it.  
The gate moved and was wide open.  
“I did it!” said Eve with a smile.  
Eve got on her bike and rode on.  
She went past the lake and grape vines.  
At last, Eve was home safe and sound.
