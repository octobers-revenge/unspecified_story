UFLI Lesson 35: short a review (incl. nasalized a)

Pam and Max had a plan.  
They sat at a big rock with a map.  
“Can we go on a quest?” asked Max.  
“Let’s find the lost lamp!” said Pam.  
They ran fast past the big plant.  
Pam had a red bag with snacks.  
Max had a hat and a small sapling.  
Pam and Max got to the vast sand.  
There, by the raft, sat the lost lamp.  
“Yay! We did it!” said Pam, and both kids were glad.
