On a big, wet day, a clam sat on a rock.  
He was clad in shiny shells.  
His name was Clem.  
Clem was glad to be by the sea.

“Is it time to clap?” Clem said.  
“Yes, it is time!” said his clan.  
"They are here to play!"  
The clan was happy and loud.

Clem and his clan can hop and clap.  
They can jump on the sand.  
They can dig in the wet, soft mud.  
They can run and splash, too!

“Look at us!” they said with glee.  
“We are a big, happy clan!  
We can clink and clop!”  
They clapped and laughed on the rock.

At the end of the day,  
Clem and his clan sat on a bench.  
They were tired but glad.  
“We are the best clan!” they said.
