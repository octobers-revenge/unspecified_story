        "justification": "Clem is mostly consistent but shows some variations in features, such as the colors of his shell and expressions across different pages. For instance, in the second image, Clem has large eyes that are not seen in the other images, and in the last image, his expression is slightly different compared to the original design. We lose some consistency in appearance."
