UFLI Lesson 120: -ture

Ben had a big plan. 
He wanted an adventure in the woods with his best pal, Max. 
Ben had a map with a picture of the trail.

The sun was bright as they set off. 
Birds sang, and streams ran through the woods. 
Ben and Max spotted a tiny nest in a tree. “Look at this!” said Max with glee. 
Ben took a picture to save the moment.

They walked on and saw many things. 
Each step was a new joy. 
Ben and Max smiled at their adventure.

After a while, they reached a fork in the path. 
“Which way should we go?” asked Ben. 
Max wanted to see more of the woods. 
They chose the path to the right.

Ben saw a log and sat down to rest. 
Max joined him, and they shared a snack. 
“Here is a bag full of treats,” said Max. T
he friends munched, enjoying the tasty mixture.

Suddenly, clouds began to gather. 
Ben and Max knew it was time to go back. 
They had to head back before the rain.

The departure was quick but fun. 
With each step, they shared stories they loved. 
The adventure had captured their hearts. 
At last, they reached their starting point.

Ben signed the map to mark their trail. 
“It’s like our signature on this journey,” he said. 
Ben and Max went home, happy with their big day.
