UFLI Lesson 91: ew, ui, ue = /ū/

I'm evaluating the story based on the given rubric:

1. **Word Meaning Complexity:** 
   - The story uses simple language with only a couple of potentially unfamiliar words ("blueprint") supported by context: Ideal.
   
2. **Narrative Elements:**
   - The story has clear characters (Ben and Tam), setting (the park, shed, and garage), problem (building a treehouse), events (steps of building the house and painting it), and solution (successfully building and painting the treehouse): Ideal.
   
3. **Event Sequence:**
   - The events are meaningfully connected from discovering the blueprint to completing the treehouse. There are no disconnected events: Ideal.
   
4. **Oral Language Register:**
   - The dialogue and narrative sound like natural spoken language: Ideal.

Since all criteria are Ideal, the story meets the rubric's requirements, and therefore, it can be returned unchanged:

Ben and Tam were twin brothers.  
It was a bright Tuesday morning.  
Ben and Tam sat on a bench in the park.  
Ben had a new blue box.  
He did not know what was inside.

“Can we open it?” asked Tam.  
Ben said, “Yes, let’s take a look.”  
They opened the box with care.  
Inside, they found a new blueprint.  
The blueprint showed a treehouse plan.

“We can build this,” said Tam.  
“We need wood and nails,” said Ben.  
They went to the shed.  
In the shed, they found a bag of nails.  
Tam found some wood by the shed.

“Let’s get to work,” said Ben.  
They followed the blueprint step by step.  
Ben held the nails.  
Tam used a hammer.  
Tap, tap, tap went the hammer.

They worked all day.  
They did not stop for lunch.  
Ben went to get juice to drink.  
Tam had an idea.  
“We can have fruit for a snack,” he said.

As they ate, a new idea came to Tam's mind.  
“We should paint the treehouse blue,” Tam said.  
Ben loved the idea.  
But they had no blue paint.

Then their mom came with news.  
“Dad has blue paint in the garage!” she said.  
Ben and Tam ran to the garage.  
They found the blue paint and a brush.  
They painted the house in the blue shade.

Soon, the treehouse was done.  
Ben and Tam looked at each other with big smiles.  
They were so proud.  
The blueprint helped them the whole time.  
“What will we build next Tuesday?” asked Ben.

Tam grinned and said, “Let’s wait and see!”  
Ben agreed with a nod.  
They were both happy with the new blue treehouse.  
It was the best day they had all week.  
They could not wait to show it to their friends.
