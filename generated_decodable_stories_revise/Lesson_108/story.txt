UFLI Lesson 108: doubling rule: -er, -est

**Revised Story:**

Tom and Sam sat by a big pond.  
The day was the hottest of the year.  
Tom said, "The pond will help us cool."  
They dipped their feet in the water.  
Sam felt the water was cooler than the air.  
Their smiles got bigger as they splashed.  
Tom said, "Let's see who gets the wettest!"  
Sam laughed and splashed some more.  
The pond made them happy, not sad.  
Tom lifted his arms and did a big spin.  
"The sun shines on the pond," Sam said.  
They stayed until the sun began to set.  
At last, they left the pond, feeling a bit sad.  
But Tom said, "That was the most fun!"  
They waved goodbye to the pond and went home.
