UFLI Lesson 95: oi, oy = /oi/

Roy had a toy box. He liked to keep his toys there. One day, Roy found a coin in the box. The coin was shiny and bright. Roy’s friend, Joy, came to play. Roy showed Joy the coin. “Let’s use it to buy a new toy!” said Joy. Roy liked this idea.

They went to the toy shop. At the shop, they saw many toys. Roy picked a toy duck that made a noise. Joy liked the toy too. “It’s a good choice,” Joy said. Roy gave the coin to the shop man. The shop man took the coin. Now, Roy and Joy had a new toy to enjoy. They played with the toy at home. Roy and Joy felt full of joy with their new toy.
