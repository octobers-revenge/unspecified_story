UFLI Lesson 37: short o review

Bop the dog sat on a big log.  
He had a soft mop that was his.  
His job was to hop and jog around the pond.  
One day, the pond got a lot of fog.  
Bop could not see the path.  
His mop fell into the pond with a plop.  
Bop let out a small sob.  
But then, his pal Pip the frog came.  
Pip was a quick swimmer and found the mop.  
Bop was glad and wagged his tail.  
The fog went away, and the sun came out.  
Bop and Pip jogged back to the log.  
They had fun and a big nap on the soft cot.
