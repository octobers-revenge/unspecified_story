UFLI Lesson 80: er = /ər/

Mister Ted had a pet hen.

Her name was Fern.

Fern liked to perch on a big log.

Mister Ted had a big farm with many hens.

His sister Meg liked to help him.

“Let’s feed the hens,” said Mister Ted.

Meg and Mister Ted went to feed the hens.

Fern was hungry and came first.

“Did you see that?” asked Meg.

“Yes,” said Mister Ted. "Fern is quick!"

After the hens ate, Mister Ted and Meg went to rest under a tree.

“Meg, look at these logs!” said Mister Ted.

Meg began to count each of them.

“I see ten logs,” Meg said.

Mister Ted smiled and said, “That’s right!”

“Let’s plant a fern here,” Mister Ted said.

“Yes!” said Meg. “That is a great idea.”

They began to dig in the dirt.

Mister Ted and Meg placed a fern under the tree.

“Now Fern will perch here too,” said Meg.

Mister Ted and Meg were happy.

“Let’s see if Fern likes it,” said Mister Ted.

They watched as Fern found the new perch.

“Oh, she likes her perch!” said Meg.

Fern sat on the perch and took a nap.
