UFLI Lesson 48: ch = /ch/

Chad and his friend Chuck talked about lunch.  
They wanted to find a nice spot in the park.  
They packed a big lunch with lots to eat.  
Chad put a chicken sandwich in the bag.  
Chuck packed chips and a sweet bun.  

At the park, they sat on a soft bench.  
They set the lunch on the bench and took a drink.  
Chad noticed something in a bush.  
In the bush, a little bird hopped and drank from a pond.  

Chad and Chuck watched.  
The birds in the bush were having fun.  
With a smile, Chad said, "Let the birds eat a bit."  
Chad took a bite of his sandwich, and Chuck ate a chip.  

The lunch was fun in the sun.  
When lunch was done, they relaxed and had a nap.  
Chad and Chuck had a happy day.
