UFLI Lesson 57: VCe review 1: e_e = /ē/

Tom came home with his bike. He saw a white gate at the front. The gate was open, and he rode in. His friend Jake was there by the stone path. Tom and Jake had a plan. 

Tom had to find a rope. Jake had to make a maze. The sun was high, and they had lots of time. Tom got the rope quickly. Jake had some old poles and set them up.

They used the rope to mark the path. “It’s a maze!” said Tom, smiling. Jake gave a big smile too. But then, a gust of wind came and knocked over one pole. “Oh no!” said Tom.

Jake ran to get a new pole. He set it up fast. “Now the maze is set,” said Jake. They called their friends to come and play. Everyone had fun running through the maze.

Tom and Jake both had a great time. They closed the gate as evening came. They were glad the maze could stay for more fun.
