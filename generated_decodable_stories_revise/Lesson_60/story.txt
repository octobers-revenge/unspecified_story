UFLI Lesson 60: -ce = /s/

Tom and Pam had a plan. 
They wanted to have a fun day. 
Pam got her bike, and Tom got his. 
They rode to the big park.

At the park, they saw a race. 
The mice had a fun race on the grass. 
“Look at those mice race!" said Tom. 
“They run so fast!"

Tom smiled and said, 
“I can trace our path. 
Let's race to that nice spot and back.”

Pam and Tom set a fast pace. 
“If we race, we must be quick,” said Pam.

But then Tom hit a soft patch of mud. 
His bike began to slip and slid on the dirt. 
Tom had to stop and let Pam pass. 
He felt sad but then gave a grin.

Pam looked back and saw Tom. 
She went back to help her chum. 
“Let me help you,” said Pam.

They pushed the bike out of the mud. 
“It was nice of you to come back,” said Tom. 
“Friends help and stick by each other,” said Pam.

“I may not win, but I am glad you are here,” said Tom. 
“Thanks, Pam,” he added with a wide grin.

In the end, they both had fun. 
They rode side by side and saw more things in the park. 
It was a nice day in the sun.
